Chapter 1

In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.

"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," he tole me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you';ve had."

he didn't say any more but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and i understyood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence I'm inclined tyo reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men.

Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn of again at a more rakish angle but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the old alignment gave a blurred air to her fave. When she moved about there was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets jingled up and down upon her arms.
She came in with such a proprietary haste and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I wondered if she lived here. But when i asked her she laughed immoderately, repeated my question aloud and told me she lived with a girl friend at a hotel.
